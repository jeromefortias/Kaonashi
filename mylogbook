This morning, I finished managing entities. I need to add a few features, but it was cool. I created a cool generic method for doing fuzzy searches on all the text contained in an index. It was fun. No vibecoding, BUT I used Visual Studio's AI assistant (Copilot) to fix a bug, and honestly, it works well. This afternoon, I'm taking a break. Message perso aux tarés qui m'ont chié dessus à cause de ma position sur le drama (queen) Julia MrPhi , j'ai une citation d'un grand penseur "M'enfin" - Gaston Lagaffe

Yesterday, on September 8, 2025, I initiated the Kaonashi project. It’s a solution based on the Democrite agent distribution framework, where I’m trying to combine an AI Assistant, AI applied to document management, and intelligence algorithms. I’m not a real developer, but rather an AI Architect—so it’s not exactly easy. I named this project Kaonashi, after the faceless character from a movie I love, Spirited Away. This project will also give me the opportunity to explain different approaches on my YouTube channel: youtube.com/@lelabia
. Please, don’t be too harsh...Feel cool to follow my journey and share your thoughts!
